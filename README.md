# Data Science Projects with Python

This repository contains some data science portfolio projects for academic, self-improvement and hobby purposes.
Projects are prepared in iPyhon Notebook format.

Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only.

* ### Deep Learning

	- [Generate TV Script with RNN](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/BostonHousePrediction/BostonPrediction.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

* ### Machine Learning

	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/BostonHousePrediction/BostonPrediction.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	
	- [Predicting Advertisement](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/AdvertisementPrediction/AdvertisementPrediction.ipynb): In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

	- [Lending Club](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/LendingClub/LendingClub.ipynb): For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors).
	
	- [Iris Flower](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/IrisFlower/IrisFlower.ipynb): In this project we will use the support vector machine method in examining the famous iris data set.
	
	- [Clustering Universities](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/ClusteringUniversities/ClusteringUniversities.ipynb): For this project we will attempt to use KMeans Clustering to cluster Universities into to two groups, Private and Public.
	
     _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

	> ### Natural Language Processing

	- [Classify Yelp Reviews](https://github.com/ebegen/Data-Science-Projects-with-Python/blob/master/ClassifyYelpReviews/ClassifyYelpReviews.ipynb): In this NLP project we will be attempting to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews.
